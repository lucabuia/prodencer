# Multipole project

Multipole projection code in Python for projecting charge/spin densities from VASP and Abinit onto the atomic multipoles (tesseral harmonics).

TO DO
- make sure that it works for the case of a charge-only density (no spin)
- add symmetry: given the coordinates of an atom, the code calculates the multipoles for that position and also all the other positions realated by symmetry (Wyckoff)
