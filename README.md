# Multipole project

Multipole projection code in Python for projecting charge/spin densities from VASP and Abinit onto the atomic multipoles (tesseral harmonics).


TO DO
- make sure that it works for the case of a charge-only density (no spin)
- add function that does inverse projection (takes coefficients and positions and prints a fictitious density with the appropriate atomic multipoles)
