# Multipole project

<img src="Logo.png" alt="ProDenCeR logo" width="250"/>

Multipole projection code in Python for projecting charge/spin densities from VASP and Abinit:
1) In spheres around atoms onto the atomic multipoles (tesseral harmonics);
2) In the entire unit cell onto the irreducible representation of the space groups (through spglib).
