# Multipole project

Multipole projection code in Python for projecting charge/spin densities from VASP and Abinit:
1) In spheres around atoms onto the atomic multipoles (tesseral harmonics);
2) In the entire unit cell onto the irreducible representation of the space groups (through spglib).


TO DO
- make sure that it works for the case of a charge-only density with Abinit (no spin)
